Hello, this is an introduction to writing a class in C++.
We will look at three files:
	1. student.h (class definition)
	2. student.cpp (class function definitions)
	3. main.cpp  (driver file/main)
When you are done looking at these, you should be able to write your own basic
class. Or at least remember some core concepts about classes.

My tabs are 4 spaces, so the file is aligned with that in mind.
Please start in student.h and follow along from there.

When you're done you should be able to write a class with three different
constructors, accessors, mutators, and overloaded operators for >>, <<, and +.
