# D
#### Notes by Michael Ranciglio
## About
D is a new(er) language and I really like it. However, like all languages it still has its own nuances. I will be listing all of the general things I would like to remember.

### Changing output names in D
The official way is: `dmd hello_world.d -of=hello_world.out`
* `-of=name_of_file` will generate an output file called "`name_of_file`"
